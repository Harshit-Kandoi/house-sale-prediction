### Project Overview

The House Price Prediction Model is designed to estimate the market value of a house based on features like:

- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location
- Year built
- Lot size

Using these factors, the model leverages machine learning algorithms to predict house prices in a specified region.

### Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Data

The dataset used for this project consists of house features and sale prices. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) or use any real estate dataset available. Ensure that the data is preprocessed properly before training the model.

- **Data Columns**: 
  - `sqft_living`: Square footage of living area
  - `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
  - `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
  - `yr_built`: Year the house was built
  - `price`: Sale price of the house (target variable)

### Model

The project utilizes a machine learning model trained on the preprocessed data. The key steps include:

1. **Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, categorical encoding, feature scaling.
2. **Modeling**: Training different models like linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost to find the best fit.
3. **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using RMSE and MAE.

### Usage

To run the model, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the Data**: 
    Run the data preprocessing script to clean the data and prepare it for training.
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

2. **Train the Model**: 
    Train the machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset.
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. **Make Predictions**: 
    After training, use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input new_data.csv
    ```

### Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **RMSE**: XX.XX
- **MAE**: XX.XX

You can visualize the performance by running:
```bash
python plot_results.py
```
